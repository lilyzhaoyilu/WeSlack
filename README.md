WeSlack is a solo demo project that clones Slack. It is a communication webapp where users can send live messages in channels and directly to each other. It was built utilizing a Ruby on Rails backend with a React/Redux fronted.

This project was created within approximately 10 days as a demo project, and this is my first solo project. There are many parts that can be improved, but hey, it is how things start.

- Send is disabled when the input area is empty

### Search
